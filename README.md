# Welcome to Bamazon!

bamazonCustomer.js displays a list of available products to the user. The user is then prompted to enter the Item ID for the product they would like to purchase, and the amount of product they would like. They are then given the total dollar figure for their purchase, and given the opprotunity to make further purchases.

bamazonManager allows the user to view the products being sold, view only products with a quantity size below 5 (low inventory), update a product's inventory, and even add a new product.
